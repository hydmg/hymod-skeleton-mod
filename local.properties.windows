# Windows Hytale Installation Path configuration
# Rename this file to local.properties to use it.

# OPTION 1: Use forward slashes (Recommended, works reliably)
hytaleHome=C:/Users/<USERNAME>/AppData/Local/Hytale

# OPTION 2: Use double backslashes (If you prefer backslashes, you MUST double them to escape)
# hytaleHome=C:\\Users\\YOUR_USER\\AppData\\Local\\Hytale

# DO NOT use single backslashes like C:\Users... because \ is an escape character.
